# DesignPatterns

This repository contains the programs, which are related to Design Patterns that includes Core, J2EE and other related 
patterns.

All the examples, used in this repository to be written in ```Java```.


## What are design patterns?

Before knowing to know the design patterns, let's ask 1 more question?

- What do you mean by a pattern?

    - A pattern is a repeated design or recurring sequence.
    
    OR
    
    - An ordered set of numbers, shapes or other mathematical objects, arranged according to a rule.    

Know let's come back to our actual question.

As per wikipedia [System Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

```text
In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem 
within a given context in software design.
```

Design patterns are the solutions for recurring problems in some given context, which are tried and tested.

Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book ```Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software``` was published in 1994 by the so-called ```Gang of Four```, which is frequently abbreviated as ```GoF```.

## Classification

Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on the kind of problem they solve.

- Creational
    
    These patterns provide the capability to create objects based on a required criteria and in a controlled way.
    
- Structural

    These patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new 
    functionality.
    
- Behavioral

    These patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
